                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2.
                    Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                    individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                    \    restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or
                    \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".     Those
                    cannot be well described when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.
                    \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                    by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                    \ 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is
                    not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                    interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                    dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the version
                    of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change
                    it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                    to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new
                    APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n
