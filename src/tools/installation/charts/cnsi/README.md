# Cloud Native Security Inspector (Project Narrows) Helm Chart

Cloud Native Security Inspector is an open source cloud native runtime security tool. It allows end users to assess
the security posture of Kubernetes clusters at runtime. This project will add dynamic scanning giving Security Auditors
greater awareness and control of running workloads.

## Requirements
- Kubernetes >= 1.24
- Helm >= 2.17.0
- We recommend you to have 8 GiB of memory available for this deployment, or at least 4 GiB for the minimum requirement.
Else, the deployment is expected to fail. 
## Installing
```shell
$ helm install [release-name] src/tools/installation/charts/cnsi
```
## Uninstalling
```shell
$ helm uninstall [release-name]
```
This will not delete CRD generated by narrows on the fly. 
You can get and delete CRD manually using below commands:
```shell
$ kubectl get crd
$ kubectl delete crd inspectionpolicies.goharbor.goharbor.io settings.goharbor.goharbor.io
```
Also you need to delete the cronJobs and daemonSets generated in the workspace you defined in the policy.
The quickest way is to delete the workspace directly:
```shell
kubectl delete ns <the_workspace_in_policy>
```

## Configuration
You can specify your own image registry and image tag to install.
```shell
$ helm install [release-name] src/tools/installation/charts/cnsi/ --set image.repository="your-own-repository" --set image.tag="latest"
```
If you'd like to install Cloud Native Security Inspector without OpenSearch:
```shell
$ helm install [release-name] src/tools/installation/charts/cnsi/ --set opensearch.enabled=false
```
