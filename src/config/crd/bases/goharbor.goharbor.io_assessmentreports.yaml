                                        are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                                        its usage when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored
                                        fields.  It includes many fields which are
                                        not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                                        and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                                        actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                        is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                        usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                                        particular     restrictions like, \"must refer
                                        only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                                        or \"name must be restricted\".     Those
                                        cannot be well described when embedded.  3.
                                        Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                                        are different, the validation rules are different
                                        by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                                        predict what will happen.  4. The fields are
                                        both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is
                                        not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce
                                        ambiguity     during interpretation and require
                                        a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                                        is on the group,resource tuple     and the
                                        version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                                        \ 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                                        to this type     will affect numerous schemas.

                                            For example, if the object reference is
                                            to a container within a pod, this would
                                            take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                            (where "name" refers to the name of the
                                            container that triggered the event) or
                                            if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                                            (container with index 2 in this pod).
                                            This syntax is chosen only to have some
                                            well-defined way of referencing a part
                                            of an object. TODO: this design is not
